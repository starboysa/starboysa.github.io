<div class="entry-content">
<p>
Welcome!
</p>
<p>
My name is Jacob McPeak. I'm a senior DigiPen Institute of Technology graduating soon! (April 2019)
<br>
I'm studying software engineering and I focus on tools and network engineering.
</p>

<p>
Networking has always been magical to me.
Throughout my childhood and into my adult life multiplayer games have always been how my friends and I come together to hang out.
Even before VOIP became super popular I was on the land line with my friends in middle school grinding away in WoW and Runescape.
When I started making games in 7th grade I always wanted to add multiplayer so I could play my games with my friends, but my engine of choice (GameMaker: Free Edition) didn't support networking and even if it did I wouldn't have had the technical know-how to use it.
It wasn't until recently that I even considered networking as an option for me professionally.
Even after I took the first networking class at DigiPen it didn't click.
It wasn't until I made my first networked game was I convinced that this was something I wanted to delve deep into.
I took a small bomber-man clone Unity game I made and added internet play.
Immediately it was clear the added social dynamic made this mediocre clone into an extremely enjoyable time waster.
It's that social aspect that makes me really excited and interested in network engineering.
</p>

<p>
With my spare time I listening to music (rap/hip hop recently, I love the energy they put into their music), reading (Game of Thrones, I know I'm behind), writing (this blog), and, of course, gaming.
</p>

<p>
I still play a lot of co-op multiplayer games, I don't think I'll ever fully scratch that itch.
I've recently gotten the change to level through BFA on Alliance which was lots of fun. I really enjoyed Stormsong Valley.
I also play pretty much every ARPG on the market. I keep max level characters every season/league of Diablo 3 and PoE. Betrayal is an outstanding league and I hope keep the quality content coming.
</p>

<p>
When I'm playing by myself I'll dump some time into an RPG or the latest action titles.
Sometimes you get the best of both worlds, like Kingdom Hearts 3!
I've got thick nostalgia goggles for that game, but there's a lot of problems.
I think the Kingdom Hearts series is probably the for-runners in the spectacle fighter genre and KH3 delivers hard on that front, but it fails in story telling and game length.
</p>

<p>
And since I don't want to fill this page with me talking about the games I'm playing, here's a quick list of games I've been playing:
<ul>
  <li>Kingdom Hearts 3</li>
  <li>Divinity: Original Sin 2</li>
  <li>Path of Exile</li>
  <li>Pillars of Eternity II: Dreadfire</li>
  <li>Titanfall 2</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Welp, thatâ€™s about it from me. Thank you for your time and I hope you find something interesting on this website.
</p>
