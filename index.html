<div class="entry-content">
<p>
Hello,
</p>
<p>
My name is Jacob McPeak, a senior DigiPen Institute of Technology graduating in 2019. I'm studying software engineering with a focus on game networking.
</p>

<p>
Networking has always been magical to me. Throughout my childhood and into my adult life multiplayer games have always been how my friends and I come together to hang out. Even before VOIP became super popular I was on the land line with my friends in middle school grinding away in WoW and Runescape. When I started making games in 7th grade I always wanted to add multiplayer so I could play my games with my friends, but that was very out of scope for me back then. It wasn't until recently that I even considered networking as an option for me professionally. Even after I took the first networking class at DigiPen it didn't click. Not until I made my first networked game was I convinced this is what I wanted to do as a career. I've always had more fun playing games with my friends than by myself and getting to play a game I made with a friend over the Internet elevated the fun of this small game I made in Unity over the weekend from mediocre to extremely enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
Since then, studying networking has consumed my free time. But when I get time to myself I spend it listening to music (specifically rap, been going through Kendrik Lamar's older stuff lately), reading (GoT), and writing (this blog). I strive to make it obvious that everything I make was made by me so the posts on this blog might seem oddly dramatic or comedic at times, but just know that's my way of entertaining myself while I'm organizing my thoughts.
</p>

<p>
But in the unlikely event that I have some to play games I'll typically pick some multiplayer game. Games like Diablo 3, League of Legends, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft are my first choice. If no one is on I'll move on to some RPG like Divinity Original Sin 2, Fallout 4, or Diablo 3.
</p>

<p>
Welp, thatâ€™s about it from me. Thank you for your time and I hope you find something interesting on this website.
</p>
