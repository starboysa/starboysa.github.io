	<div class="entry-content"><p>I found myself in an environment where I couldn&rsquo;t easily set up a TCP connection between clients that I wanted to send an image between them.
I didn&rsquo;t want to just re-implement TCP because I wouldn&rsquo;t have any other use for the reliability;
The only thing I have to do and the only thing I want to do is send these images.
So I came up with my own involuntary image transfer protocol.</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>


<p>It&rsquo;s really simple. The first thing the host does is fragment the file (a compressed version) into as many packets as it needs to.
The host sends a packet to the client that contains a unique ID for the image and how many fragments the file has.
Every RTT (you can measure it or just guess ~100ms) the client sends a packet filled with fragment IDs that it hasn&rsquo;t gotten yet (which would be all of them at first).
The host sends all fragments that have been requested to the client.</p>

<p>This protocol elegantly takes care of packet loss, out of order packets, high latency, and if you measure RTT it also has a form of congestion control.
With a small extension to the protocol you could have multiple servers send fragments to the client which could service a Torrent like peer-to-peer network.</p>

<p>The best part is that this protocol is trivial to implement on top of UDP and that&rsquo;s the main goal.</p>

<h3>Is It Fast?</h3>


<p>Kind of?</p>

<p>I want to say it&rsquo;s slow because the way the client requests missing packets means that it&rsquo;s receiving data in waves of fragments.
This means it&rsquo;s not receiving a steady stream of data which I would assume would be faster.</p>

<p>However, the bloat around TCP (specifically it&rsquo;s sawtooth congestion control) is painful and since this protocol is built on UDP it could be faster on a high congestion network.</p>

<p>The real thing I need to do is just run some tests.
So I&rsquo;ve done so: (These are 50% done, will update as soon as possible)</p>
