Project from Freshmen year at DigiPen. This was my first experience developing an engine other programmers. At the time this was challenging especially since we were restricted to C. We partially re-implemented some C++ features like classes and member functions. Given a second chance I wouldn’t have taken this approach. We wanted to use a Component – GameObject model for our engine because it was really all I knew at the time having only been exposed to Unity and the Zero engine. Instead of using that model, which relies heavily on OOP concepts, I’d create an engine that is more focused on systems and I’d just store all state information on some sort of blackboard system. Still really proud of this game though as it’s the first game I’ve finished and the first game I’ve worked on with other people!
